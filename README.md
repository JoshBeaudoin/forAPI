For this assigment we had to create 5 queries from a space set up using storyblok's demo content using postman, The 5 i chose was Logo (Logo sets up the first logo you see on the webpage you open), Nav_Links (Nav_Links sets up multiple links in one nav bar so you can group more things together easier), Button Text (Pretty simple just makes it s you can label your buttons easier), Button_Links ( Like Nav_links execpt Button_Links uses only one link because most buttons will be single use), and lastly i had used Styles (Styles makes it easier to set up styles from everything from your texts to your images).
